  <li>Draw on one device. You should see (in some inevitable delay) on another device!</li>
  <li>Make sure both devices have good Internet connection; otherwise it may not be as "realtime" as you may expect.</li>
  <li>If you don't see it on another device after 30 seconds, </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Refresh the board by opening it again;</li>
    <li>Closes the app and reopen it.</li>
